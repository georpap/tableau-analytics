The dataset was already clean so I could proceed with the analysis and visualizations
Performed aggregation in order to find the total number of games in the period of analysis

### DEFINE THE STATS TO ANALYZE


1. Distributions were made of the age, the weight and the division of the fighters.
2. Presented a line chart where the evolution of the sport is shown. Specifically aggregation was performed for the total matches per year.
3. Top fighters were chosen based on their popularity and analysis was performed on their stats:
    * wins by KO/TKO
    * wins by submission
    * wins by unanimous decision
    * maximum win streak
4. Treemaps for the total title bouts of each of the prementioned fightes. (Title bout refers to the games fought either for defending or attempting for belt.)
